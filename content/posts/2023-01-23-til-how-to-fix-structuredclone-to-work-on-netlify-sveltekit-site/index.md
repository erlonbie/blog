**TIL: How to fix `structuredClone` to work on Netlify SvelteKit Site**

Recently I was working on my SvelteKit site and added some code like so to my `hook.server.ts`:

```ts {hl_lines=[4]}
try {
    if (event.locals.pb.authStore.isValid) {
        await event.locals.pb.collection("users").authRefresh();
        event.locals.user = structuredClone(event.locals.pb?.authStore.model);
    }
} catch (err) {
    console.log("failed to refresh auth", err);
    event.locals.user = undefined;
    event.locals.pb.authStore.clear();
}
```

I needed to add the `structuredClone` function so that only POJO (plain old javascript objects) would get stored in the `event.locals.users`
variable. However when I deployed this to production in Netlify. This broke my site! Specifically, it wouldn't let the user log in.

If you deploy your SvelteKit app on Netlify the server-side code gets turned into functions for us automagically! I was able to work out
that `structuredClone` function broke my app because in my `login` function I could see something like:

```
ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined
```

It seems that the `structuredClone` was only added in nodejs 17 [^1]. However, Netlify functions default to nodejs 16.

> For all Node.js functions deployed on or after July 11, 2022, Netlify uses Node.js 16 as the default runtime. - https://docs.netlify.com/functions/optional-configuration/?fn-language=js

Reading the docs we can see if we set the `AWS_LAMBDA_JS_RUNTIME` in the GUI to `nodejs18.x` this will force our functions to use nodejs 18.

And that's it! By setting our nodejs version to 18, we will be able to use the `structuredClone` function.
