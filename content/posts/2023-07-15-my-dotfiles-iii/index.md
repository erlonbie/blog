My latest iteration of my dotfiles, where I am now using a Laptop as my main development machine (Framework).
I'm also using Hyprland as my window manager. Most importantly using NixOS and home-manager to declaratively define
the state of my machine i.e. what packages to install, dotfiles.

**CURRENTLY A WIP**

:house: My dotfiles repo, setup using nixos/home-manager

## Install

> :fire: I wouldn't recommend just blinding using my dotfiles. They are setup for my specific use-case.
I think you're off using this repo as reference to create your own dotfiles.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hmajid2301/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles/
cd dotfiles

nix develop

# To build system configuration
sudo nixos-rebuild --flake .#framework

# To build user configuration
home-manager --flake .#framework
```

You can read more about my dotfiles and development workflows on my [blog here](https://erlonbie.github.io/series/my-development-workflow/) (#ShamelessPlug).

> Note my dotfiles are almost always changing!

## Features

Some features of my dotfiles:

- Structured to allow multiple **NixOS configurations**, including **desktop**, **laptop**
- **Declarative** config including **themes**, **wallpapers** and **nix-colors**
- **Opt-in persistance** through impermanence + blank snapshot
 - Delete files on boot
- **Encrypted btrfs partition** 
- **sops-nix** for secrets management
- Different environments like **hyprland** and **gnome**
- Laptop setup with eGPU and **vfio** for playing games on windows

## Structure

- `flake.nix`: Entrypoint for hosts and home configurations
- `nixos`: 
  - `global`: Configurations that are globally applied to all my machines
  - `optional`: Configurations that some of my machines use
- `hosts`: NixOS Configurations, accessible via `nixos-rebuild --flake`.
  - `framework`: Framework 12th gen laptop | Hyprland | eGPU 7900 XTX
- `home-manager`: Most of my dotfiles configuration, user specific

## Devices

Here is a list of the devices this repo is used to configure.

## Applications

I basically just installed every package from [Modern Unix](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix).

CLI tools that I use often include:

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): Fuzzy search tool
  - Especially for reverse search in my terminal with [fish shell](https://github.com/PatrickF1/fzf.fish)
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide): Smarter cd tool, integrated well with fzf, nvim and tmux
- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa): A replacement for `ls` with better syntax highlighting
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): A faster `grep`
- [navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi): Interactive cheat sheet

### Tmux

I manage my projects using tmux sessions with the [tmux smart session manager](https://github.com/joshmedeski/t-smart-tmux-session-manager).

Where I create a new session for each project I'm working on and then jump between them.
Where a project might be:

- My Blog
- My Dotfiles
- Full stack application
  - A window for each project i.e. GUI and API
