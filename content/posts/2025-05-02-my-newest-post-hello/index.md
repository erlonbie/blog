After another 5 months (again) I'm finally back blogging about my development setup, opps!

## What is Neovim?

Neovim is a text editor, that you can run in your terminal. Much like `vim` and `vi` or `nano`. So we would run
this inside our terminal emulator and Zellij. It differs from vim because you can configure it using lua vs vimscript
. Some of the other unique features it had, you can now do in vim (I believe). Such as tree sitter support and LSPs.

## Why Neovim?

```Rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

```
