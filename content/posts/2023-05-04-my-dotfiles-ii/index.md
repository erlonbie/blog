### Applications

I basically just installed every package from [Modern Unix](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix).
You can find a full list of all the packages I "use" [here](https://gitlab.com/hmajid2301/dotfiles/-/blob/main/meta/configs/packages.arch.yaml#L2-48).

CLI tools that I use often include:

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): Fuzzy search tool
  - Especially for reverse search in my terminal with [fish shell](https://github.com/PatrickF1/fzf.fish)
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide): Smarter cd tool, integrated well with fzf, nvim and tmux
- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa): A replacement for `ls` with better syntax highlighting
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): A faster `grep`
- [navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi): Interactive cheat sheet

### Wallpaper

![Wallpaper GIF](images/wallpaper.gif)

I wanted to have wallpaper that changes with the day, I slightly changed the [sunpaper script](https://github.com/hexive/sunpaper).
Which is a great script because it changes depending on the time of day i.e. when sunsets/rises.

I have started using nvim as my default editor (IDE?). It uses [LazyVim](lazyvim.org/) as
the base config and adds a few plugins on top.

- [trouble](https://github.com/folke/trouble.nvim): For showing all lsp diagnostic issues in a file
- [telescope zoxide](https://github.com/jvgrootveld/telescope-zoxide): For showing all lsp diagnostic issues in a file

Some of the nvim setup was heavily inspired by this [repo](https://github.com/colevoss/neovoss).
Including the status bar.
