**TIL: How to Run Android Emulator Using avd on Hyprland**

Recently, I was having issues when trying to run an Android Emulator using Android Studio (avd). When I would try to 
run an Emulator from the device manager, I would get the following `The emulator process for avd xxx has terminated error`.

Looking deeper into the logs at `~/.local/cache/Google/AndroidStudio2023.1/log/idea.log`, I noticed the following:

```bash
2024-02-20 12:01:45,859 [ 781674]   INFO - Emulator: Pixel 7 Pro API 34 - Android emulator version 33.1.24.0 (build_id 11237101) (CL:N/A)

```

Note, I did have qtwayland5 installed on my Ubuntu machine.
So get it working based on this log line `Available platform plugins are: xcb.` The simplest thing I could think of was
to run 

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb ~/Android/Sdk/emulator/emulator -avd Pixel_XL_API_33
```

Forcing it to use the platform it can find. I don't need to do much Android development, so this was fine for now.
For a better solution, you can look at this [issue](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/3417), to add both 
in your Hyprland config itself.
