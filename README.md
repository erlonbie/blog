# Blog

My personal website and blog built using Hugo.

## Theme

The theme is based of PaperModX with some of my own tweaks

- Mermaid Diagram Support
- Series posts shown
- Notice/Admonitions (Highlighted sections)
- Inline Search
	- Inspired by Blowfish Theme
- Remove newsletter
- FaunaDB to show likes per post
- Page Views
- A bunch of PRs merged (from PaperModX)


## Appendix
